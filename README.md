# fludmixing_matlab
This MATLAB-based program is designed to help students analyze the fluid mixing efficiency in laboratory experiments. It uses real video footage to detect and visualize mixing patterns based on color dispersion.

## 📌 Features

- Video selection (.mp4 or .avi)
- Background subtraction and mixing area detection
- Real-time side-by-side video display
- Turquoise overlay to highlight the Expanded Mixing Zone
- Graphs showing mixing area and color change over time
- Output video generation

## 🧪 Educational Use

This tool is intended for teaching and learning in fluid mixing and particle technology labs.

> 📎 **Free to use for educational purposes without prior permission.**

## 🖥 Requirements

- MATLAB R2020b or later
- Computer Vision Toolbox

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run `mixing_analysis.m` in MATLAB.
2. Select a video file (.mp4 or .avi).
3. Enter the required parameters when prompted.
4. Observe the live results and analyze the output video.
